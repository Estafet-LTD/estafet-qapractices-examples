/**
 * The test runner class. This is the class you need to run, when executing tests.
 * Right click on it and press Run.
 * Be aware of the following:
 * glue - path to the step definitions. It will work OOTB if you put your stepdefs in the already defined package.
 * You can add more- use the syntax shown below, separate the strings with a comma.
 * features - path to feature files. You can add new. The rules for the "glue" apply here also.
 * plugin - just don't touch.
 * tags - this is the part you will be editing most of the time. All tests should be tagged (in this context is tag,
 * not annotation, shut up) and ran through here. You can have multiple tags ran in the same run:
 * {"@Rest, @UI, @DB"}
